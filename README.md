	WantBook - Website to sell/buy used books

Description: It’s a hobby project that i have implemented to understand the basic concepts of Django framework. Website’s main features include

	1. Basic authentication features like creating account, login to profile and delete his profile.
	2. User should be able to add a book that he wants to sell.
	3. User should be able to view the details of the books that are uploaded by other sellers 
	4.User should be able to buy the books that are uploaded by the other user.

It’s an ongoing project and as of now i have implemented basic user authentication features Register, Login and Password Reset. Yet i need to implement models and views for adding the books to database and buying the books that are uploaded by other users.
